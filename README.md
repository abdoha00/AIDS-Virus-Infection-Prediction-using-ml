AIDS Virus Infection Prediction
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various attributes such as patient demographics, medical history, treatment history, and laboratory results. It was initially published in 1996 and serves as a valuable resource for predictive modeling and exploratory data analysis in the field of healthcare analytics and epidemiology.
